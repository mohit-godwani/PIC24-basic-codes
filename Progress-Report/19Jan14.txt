1> Completed SPI codes on PIC24.
2> Started working on I2C codes.
3> Compeleted theoretical study of I2C.
4> Got acqainted with registers used for impelementation of SPI and I2C in PIC24.
5> Compared SPI and I2C (priory analysis)
TBD :-
  Implementing I2C master and slave codes.
  Implementing EEPROM interfacing codes using I2C.
  
Outcomes :-
  1> Better understanding of buses and their architecture, power consumption which may prove to be useful in cases where there is
    no constraint on choice of buses.
  2> Better understanding of libraries of PIC24 and XC.

1> Completed designing the tasklist in paper
2> Compelted study of all UART and ADC registers
3> Completed flowchart illustrating basic transition between various modes and the role of OBDH in it
4> UART codes have been executed on PIC-16.


To be done - 
1>Detailing of every mode in flowchart so as to be specific about the algorithm design for various levels and modes and their subtasks.
2>FLASH interfacing codes

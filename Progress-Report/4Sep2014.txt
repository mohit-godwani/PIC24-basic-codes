________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Hardware-
	I/O Peripherals(BUS interface, ADC, DAC, Digital/Analog ports, UART)
	Debug Interface (used during development for correcting errors)
	WatchDog Timer (Resets the system in case of deadlocks)
	Hardware should be able to bear high temperature ranges, consume low power, reliability, size.
Architecture-
	Star, Distributed, Hybrid
	We are using hybrid since it reduces load on OBC and also makes system (as a whole) less prone to errors.
	ADCS and TTnC will be using our microcontroller while other sub-systems have their own MCUs.So, Hybrid is
	most suited.
Processors(ALU, Control Unit and Memory Unit)-
	Architectures- Von Neuman(Single Bus) and Harvard(modern, concurrent access to Program memory and Data memory)
	CISC/RISC-RISC preferred
Memory-
	RAM,PROM,FLASH,EEPROM (EEPROM and FLASH are externally interfaced)
Buses-
	I2C(2 wired,8-bit,bi-directional)
	SPI(4 wired)
	UART(parallel bits to serial)
	OBDH-ADCS linked through UART
	Other subsystems are linke to OBDH through SPI/I2C
MCU chosen-
	PIC24FJ256GA110(along with 2 SD cards and external EEPROM)
	
Software-
	RTOS is used since it can perform tasks within deadlines, concurrent tasks take place in real time, tasks can be
	assigned priority.
	FreeRTOS is used since it is free, has easy to use API, efficient timer and mutex.

Doubts-
	Decoupling the memory
Remaining-
	Going through FreeRTOS API
